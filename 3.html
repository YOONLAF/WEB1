    <h2>3. Genesis(창세기)</h2>
    <p><strong>Genesis...God</strong></p>

    <p>250:0 You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of
        many lives.</p>
    <p>
        God’s Message to us, the Bible, is the story of who he is, who we are, where we come from, and why we are here.
        It is a long narrative involving many players experiencing multiple and varied events. Throughout the whole
        story, we observe a lot about how God operates. We discover that he is a good God, a loving God, powerful, and
        over all things. Even when tragic and difficult things happen in our lives, God is working in ways we cannot see
        to bring about his good plans. We observe this very clearly in the dramatic and unexpected story of Joseph,
        where unimaginable tragedy is turned into spectacular good by God’s direction in this amazing story, which
        unfolds for us in chapters 37-50.</p>
