    <h2>2. Intro</h2>
    <p>This is a simple introduction to the Bible, written with our Chinese and North Korean friends in mind, so that
        they will be able to gain a basic understanding of what this Message from God is about. If I could put myself in
        God’s place...if I had all power and all knowledge simply with my thoughts and words...if I had created
        everything, and topped it off with the greatest creation, that was a living being made with many of my own
        characteristics, which is what God did when he created people...and then decided to give my greatest creation a
        gift to guide him through his life in the world where I placed him...what would it be that I would choose to
        give him? Great strength? Great wisdom? Some other ability? In the case of God, the one tangible gift he chose
        to leave us with is his Message...his Word...to us. If this is his greatest, most important gift he left us
        with, if he loves and cares for and wants the best for us...and this Book is what he chose to give to us...then
        it is surely a treasure of infinite value...for in it is the Message that he wants us to receive, to know, to
        follow, to take to heart. Reading and getting to know this Book is perhaps the most important task we can do in
        life.</p>
    <p>Each book of the Bible that follows in this booklet is given a one word description that begins with the same
        letter of the alphabet as the name of the book, so that the basic message of that book can be remembered more
        simply. Then there is one verse given from the book which conveys an important aspect of what the whole book is
        about. Following that title is a brief overview or summary of the general message and contents of each book.</p>
